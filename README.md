This is a project to toy with the NBA API. Ideally, I would like to utilize this API to try to evaluate NBA players, possibly through ML solutions.

The initial goal of this project will be to examine whether there is any correlation with NBA Combine results with minutes played in the 3 years following the first 3 years of a players'
career (years 4-6). This coincides with the first 3 years after a player's rookie contract.

Initially, I want to look at draft classes 2014-2019. One year will (2017--chosen somewhat arbitrarily) will be the holdout set.
